# chrome-background
I needed to change my chrome's background daily. Hence the extension.

### Running the extension
Extract the zip file to a particular destination. Now go to 'more tools' inside Chrome and then click on 'extensions'. After this select the 'load unpacked extension' option and then select the extracted folder.

**Works for Google (India) for now**
